## Project Overview
This project explores **Uber trip data** to uncover trends, patterns, and business insights. Using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**, the analysis highlights trip volumes, peak demand times, vehicle utilization, and base performance.  

The goal: **turn raw data into actionable insights for operational optimization**.

## Key Metrics at a Glance
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Peak Daily Trips | ~100,000 (mid-February) |
| Low Daily Trips | ~25,000â€“40,000 (early January) |
| Avg Trips per Vehicle | 8â€“9 |
| Contribution of Top 2 Bases | ~80% of total trips |
